The Thingspeak plugin allows users to create Indigo Home Control Server 
devices which provide a facility to upload Indigo data to Thingspeak for 
charting and other purposes. 

Each individual device can contain up to eight data elements for upload. 
There is no limit to the number of Thingspeak Channels that the plugin 
can support.
