The Thingspeak plugin allows users to create Indigo Home Control Server 
devices which provide a facility to upload Indigo data to Thingspeak for 
charting and other purposes. 

Each individual device can contain up to eight data elements for upload. 
There is no limit to the number of Thingspeak Channels that the plugin 
can support.

Notes: The Thingspeak plugin requires Internet access in order to upload 
data to the Internet-based Thingspeak service; however, the plugin can 
be used without Internet access if used with a locally-installed 
Thingspeak server. The plugin does require Internet access to check for 
plugin software updates.
