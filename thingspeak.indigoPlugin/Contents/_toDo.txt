Thingspeak Plugin - Developed by: DaveL17

ToDo:
- Prettify debug output to Indigo log.

- Change kstateimagesel to .Error when that function is available.

- Update other plugins to take advantage of new
  - sleep settings
  - annotation of optional settings in plugins and manuals
  - immediate application of plugin prefs

Future:

- Twitter stuff?

- Status?

- Consider adding some additional device states like:
  - if there was an error,
  - etc.

- Provide a menu item to pull down information FROM Thingspeak??
  - This is handled somewhat by logging the upload return. But there is
    a potential need to download the entire data set and other information.
 
- Allow devices to control their own individual upload intervals?
  - This is non-trivial as the plugin would need to track mulitple
    instances for multiple devices rather than a single sleep. One way
    would be to set a "Next Data Upload" state for each device and 
    then poll the states every 'n' seconds.  Need to think more about
    the best way to make this happen.
