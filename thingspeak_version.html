Version: 1.1.01
EmailSubject: Thingspeak Indigo Plugin - Update Available
EmailBody: The Thingspeak Plugin you are using has been updated.

NOTE: This update may not be compatible with prior versions.

You should be able to reconfigure each Thingspeak device individually and
continue to use existing devices once they have been reconfigured. It is
probably best to disable all Thingspeak devices before applying this update,
and reconfigure each device one at a time.

- Adds a plugin menu tool to create a new Thingspeak channel.
- Adds a plugin menu tool to update an existing Thingspeak channel.
- Adds a plugin menu tool to list all existing Thingspeak channels.
- Adds a plugin menu tool to clear all data from an existing Thingspeak channel.
- Adds plugin configuration item for the Thingspeak API Key.
- Adds Thingspeak channel ID to the address field in the Indigo Device UI pane.
- Changes device configuration to use a channel picker rather than having to enter api key.
- Changes device configuration to allow each device to update on its own time
  table. Note that the update time won't be precise but will be within 2-3 seconds.
- Adds Twitter integration.
- Increments Python requirement to Python 2.6.
- Converts from using subprocess module to requests module.
- Improved speed - especially when device configuration dialogs are opened.
- Adds more information for plugin validation checks.
- Adds more information about state of data uploads.
- Adds ability to customize where the plugin log is stored.
- Error trapping refinements.
- UI refinements.
- Code refinements.
